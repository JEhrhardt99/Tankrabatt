\textit{As a contribution to the seminar in \enquote{Economic Transformation and Integration} (SoSe 2024), this written elaboration addresses the the prominent gravity model framework that has been used to explain patterns and determinants of trade since the 1960s. The econometric methods of estimation have become more sophisticated and trade patterns more complex. The research in the field of gravity analysis can be described as an enormously large branch. We focus on reviewing important differences when it comes to cross-border services trade and international trade of merchandise (simplified by the term \enquote{goods}). This term paper shall provide the reader with intuition and basic understanding of the two similar, yet distinct, disciplines. We conclude that using gravity tools is a more complex task when it comes to the study of trade in services as compared to trade in goods. Furthermore, the gravity approaches are likely to be used continuously in future research, since they still provide valuable insights, if constructed properly.}
